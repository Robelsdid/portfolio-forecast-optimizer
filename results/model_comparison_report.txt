MODEL CHARACTERISTICS:
-------------------------
ARIMA Model:
- Parameters: (4, 0, 2)
- AIC: 12051.51
- Type: Statistical/Classical
- Interpretability: High
- Training Time: Fast

LSTM Model:
- Hyperparameters: {'units': 100, 'layers': 1, 'dropout': 0.1, 'learning_rate': 0.01}
- Type: Deep Learning
- Interpretability: Low
- Training Time: Slow
- Complexity: High

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------

1. LSTM performs better overall for this dataset
2. Consider using LSTM for:
   - Final production models
   - When accuracy is the primary concern
   - When complex patterns need to be captured
3. ARIMA may still be useful for:
   - Baseline comparison
   - When interpretability is required
   - Quick initial analysis
