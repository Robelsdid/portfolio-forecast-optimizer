- BND: 0.4115
- SPY: 0.5885

## Metrics (Annualized)
- Expected Return: 0.0973
- Volatility: 0.1130
- Sharpe Ratio (rf=0.00%): 0.861

- TSLA receives 0% because its LSTM-implied expected return is currently negative,
  so including it would reduce risk-adjusted performance under the given constraints.
